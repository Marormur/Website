# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

    - Adds guarded listeners for languagePreferenceChange/themePreferenceChange to avoid duplicates
    - index.html now loads program-menu-sync.js before app.js; app.js defers to modular globals when present

  - Centralizes getMenuBarBottom, clampWindowToMenuBar, computeSnapMetrics, show/hideSnapPreview, hideSnapPreview
  - Loads before dialog.js in index.html to support window drag/snap behavior
